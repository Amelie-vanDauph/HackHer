This program was created at the annual 2025 hackHer.

This program planned to create a student-friendly website REUSING and RECYCLING old textbooks, calculators, student ID holders, and more -- all for an AFFORDABLE cost to fit studentâ€™s needs. 
We hope you enjoy!

This program was submitted under the beginner category + the education category (and if we have can, the sustainability category!).
